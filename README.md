## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm Rohan — an **AI Cloud Engineer** who loves building real-world machine learning systems that actually *ship*. Currently, I work at **Fipsar**, where I help architect, deploy, and scale AI applications using **AWS cloud infrastructure** and **OpenAI LLMs**.

With hands-on experience spanning **FastAPI**, **LangChain**, **ECS/Fargate**, **Lambda**, and **Secrets Manager**, I bring both machine learning and platform engineering together. I’ve built full-stack AI platforms that go beyond demos — containerized, secure, and production-ready.

My journey started in BI and data engineering at Oracle, evolved through ML research and cloud internships, and is now rooted in building serverless LLM apps, ML microservices, and embedding-based retrieval systems.

💡 I thrive on:
- Architecting cloud-native ML pipelines and inference stacks  
- Deploying AI microservices with **CI/CD, Docker, GitHub Actions**  
- Crafting **LLM-based tools**: quiz generators, resume screeners, vector matchers  
- Teaching and mentoring (I was a TA for Reinforcement Learning at PSU!)  
- Learning fast, shipping faster, and sharing openly

🎓 I hold a **Master’s in Computer Science (AI specialization)** from Portland State University, and certifications from AWS and Databricks to back up my practice in cloud AI.

If you’re building in the AI/infra/LLM space — I’m always up for collaborating, experimenting, and learning together. Let’s connect.

## ⚡ Fun Fact

I’m currently engineering LLM microservices on AWS while experimenting with self-hosted AI agents on low-end GPUs. I also break things just to rebuild them smarter 😄
